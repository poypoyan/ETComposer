To anyone reading this,

Whether you came here from my "works" in Youtube, or because of my other works
in Github, thank you for reading. I appreciate your curiosity.

Yes, the sounds this program produces are primitive. This is limited to a speci-
fic wave to make harmonies on. Consequently, there is no percussion. There are
no dynamics nor articulations nor ornaments. The rhythm is just a grid that you
can change the duration of grid length anytime, correspoding to a tempo change.

I am not saying that you should judge my works without these limitations in
mind. It is my opinion that despite the priority of Western tradition to melody,
harmony, rhythm, in that order, after all the first impression of a listener,
especially a modern one, to a music lies in timbre: just hear the popularity of
ambient music, for example. And indeed I still follow this priority of Western
tradition, as well as its idea of the "written score".

What I invite you is to improve upon my works. Yes, I provided written scores
and theory notes, but those works are experimental; the purpose of those is for
you to copy on it! In brief, my works are a study in 13EDT (equal-tempered
Bohlen-Pierce tuning), focusing on "lyrical" melody and harmony. Then this focus
on the two elements are my motivations on creating this program, aware of those
limitations written above.

This is not to say that I will not improve upon my works, too. I plan to learn a
DAW to at least cover the limitation of timbre; I will provide my work resources
FREE AND OPEN SOURCE here once I achieved it. However, at the end of the day,
I am not a musician: I am just some math nerd that heard and saw the strange and
underappreciated beauty of Bohlen-Pierce tuning, and I humbly share this beauty
for anyone who wants to listen.

Thank you again for reading this.
